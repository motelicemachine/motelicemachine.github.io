title: 2014 updates
---


We have been making some exciting changes for 2014. First we have added some new members and instruments. We are now playing a more dynamic mix of Rockabilly and Country Honkytonk style Americana music. In order to streamline things and the ever evolving lineup the name of the band has been changed to Ryan Flynt and the Motel Ice Machine. Itâ€™s just marketing. No ego issues here. We are working on a new album hoping to be released in late Spring of 2014. See ya out there.
