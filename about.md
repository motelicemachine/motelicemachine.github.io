Wanting to blend American country music and his love of rockabilly, Ryan Flynt decided to start a new band doing things his own way. So he called in some old friends and made some new ones along the way. Blending rockabilly, bluegrass, and old country, Motel Ice Machine plays a variety of styles true to themselves.
